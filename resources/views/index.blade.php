                My name is Oskar. I have a passion for computers, programming and web development. I am
                currently
                studying to become a Fullstack Web developer, focusing both on front- and backend. I consider
                myself
                a good problem solver and a thorough person, and take good time to make sure my work lives up to
                the
                highest possible standard.

                My interests
            </h2>
            <p class="p-4 mt-2 leading-9 text-xl">
                In terms of web development, I am most interested in the backend. I enjoy working with PHP and
                Laravel, Databases,
                MVC applications, and APIs. This is what I would preferably become an
                expert
                in, while having frontend development as a secondary skill, but still enough to be able to
                operate
                as a fullstack developer.

                Why should you work with me?
            </h2>
            <p class="p-4 mt-2 leading-9 text-xl">
                I see myself as a great teamplayer, and a dedicated worker. Solving problems is what programming
                is
                mostly about, and I feel like my skills in solving problems are of a good character. My assets
                would
                be of great benefit to your team.
